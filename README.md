# vue3-text-collapse

A simple lightweight component to collapse long texts.

## Demo

![Alt Text](demo.gif)

## Setup

Business as usual by running

```sh
npm i vue3-text-collapse
```

and integrating it directly into your .vue file.

```js
<script>
import { TextCollapse } from 'vue3-text-collapse'
import 'vue3-text-collapse/dist/style.css'

// some other code
</script>
```

Remember to register it with the components.

```js
<script>
// some imports

export default {
  components: {
    TextCollapse
  },

// some other code
</script>
```

And then configure __cssTarget__, the content within the corresponding templates, and that's it.

```js
<TextCollapse cssTarget="css-target-for-collapse-to-work">
  <template #heading>This is how it goes</template>
  <template #summary>
    <img src="@/assets/your-image.png" alt="your image name" />
    <p>
      Come to the point.
    </p>
  </template>
  <template #fullText>
    <p>
      Whatever long text you desire and in whatever format you like because the templates insert it with the HTML code.
    </p>
  </template>
</TextCollapse>
```

Fully working code example based on the vue.js generated template app included in the [repository](https://github.com/Dr4gon/vue-text-collapse).

```sh
npm i 
```

```sh
npm run dev
```
