### Credits

- All the images (except the icons) are created with [MidJourney](https://www.midjourney.com/) and therefore not taken from Marvel or any other source. There's absolutely no association with Marvel - also it would be very cool. They're only a humorous adaption and mix of different characters from different films or shows.

- Thank you Tony for saving us all from Thanos!
